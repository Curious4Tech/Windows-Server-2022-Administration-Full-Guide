## (Optional) Step 8: Configure IP Reservations

1. In the **DHCP Console**, expand your scope and select **Reservations**.
2. Right-click **Reservations** and select **New Reservation**.
3. Enter a **Reservation Name**, the **IP Address** you want to reserve, the **MAC Address** of the device, and an optional **Description**.

## Step 9: Verify DHCP Functionality

1. Use a client device on the network to verify it receives an IP address within the scope.
2. On the client device, run the **`ipconfig /all`** command and ensure it receives the DHCP-assigned IP.

---

## Additional Notes

- The DHCP server should now be set up and operational, with IP exclusions or reservations as needed.
- Ensure that your network devices are configured to use DHCP for automatic IP assignment.
